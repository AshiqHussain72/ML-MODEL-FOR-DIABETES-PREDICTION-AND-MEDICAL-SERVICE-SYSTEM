MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR DIABETES PREDICTION AND MEDICAL SERVICE SYSTEM
About the project :
Diabetes, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, poses a significant global 
health challenge, with its prevalence escalating rapidly. Left untreated, it leads to severe 
complications such as heart disease, kidney dysfunction, stroke, and nerve damage. Early 
detection is pivotal for effective management and prevention of complications. In this study, 
we propose a novel approach that integrates findings from multiple machine learning 
algorithms to predict diabetes onset with maximum accuracy.
Our research leverages four distinct machine learning algorithms: Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. By synthesizing 
the outputs of these algorithms, we aim to create a robust predictive model capable of 
identifying individuals at risk of diabetes at an early stage.
The primary objective of this research is twofold: first, to design a model that 
accurately predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients, and second, to propose an optimal 
solution for early diabetes detection. By amalgamating the strengths of various machine 
learning techniques, our model endeavors to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability.
Through comprehensive experimentation and validation on relevant datasets, we aim 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The ultimate goal is to contribute 
to the advancement of early diabetes detection methodologies, thereby facilitating timely 
intervention and improved patient outcomes.
The obtained results showed that our proposed method based on the SVM 
technique provides promising performances with an accuracy of 96.75% and an F1-
score of 97.66%. This improvement can reduce time, efforts, and labor in healthcare 
services as well as increasing the final decision accuracy
